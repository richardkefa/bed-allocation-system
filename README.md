# Week5 Project

Project Name: Bed Allocation System

Project Description: 
The bed allocation system allows users to login, fill in their details, select their preferred hospital, bed-type and book a bed. The user then gets an output of checkout information of his/her name, hospital selected, bed-type and the price. The user can then go ahead and confirm booking or cancel the booking. If the user confirms the booking, there's an alert to confirm that the reservation has been booked, else if the user cancels booking, page goes up so that the user can rebook. When the user is done, he/she can logout, and the page goes back to the login home page
